# Lab 02: Use Azure OpenAI with your own data

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Lab Scenario

Contoso Motors, a global automotive company, wants to improve customer support and knowledge accessibility by using Azure OpenAI with its own enterprise data. Employees and support teams often spend significant time searching through lengthy vehicle manuals and technical documents to answer customer queries. To streamline this process, Contoso plans to build an AI-powered conversational assistant using Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure Blob Storage. In this hands-on lab, you will act as a Cloud Consultant and help Contoso upload and index Porsche owner manual documents, integrate them with Azure OpenAI, and enable users to interact with the data using natural language queries through the Microsoft Foundry Chat Playground.

## Overview

In this lab, you will be using your own data with Azure OpenAI Large Language Models (LLM), which will be made searchable using Azure AI Search. You will be using the Porsche Owner's Manual PDF provided under the `C:\Users\Public\Desktop\Data\Lab 2` folder.

## You have successfully completed this Hands-on lab.

By completing this lab **Business Automation using Azure OpenAI and Document Intelligence**, you built a complete intelligent, AI-driven document processing and interaction workflow in Azure. You began by provisioning the Azure AI Document Intelligence resource to enable advanced document understanding, followed by training and labeling data to create a domain specific custom model. This model was then integrated into a Business Process Automation (BPA) pipeline for automated document processing, and Azure AI Search was configured to make the extracted information easily discoverable and accessible. Additionally, you enabled a customized AI interaction experience where the Azure OpenAI ChatGPT LLM leverages your own data, ensuring more relevant, accurate, and context specific responses tailored to your unique requirements.
